A member of this committee will be appointed by the School Director to serve as the School’s representative to the College’s Computer Resources Committee.

### Section 3: Undergraduate Affairs and Curriculum Committee

The Undergraduate Affairs and Curriculum Committee shall include one representative from each of the subfaculties across all divisions. The Assistant Director for Undergraduate Affairs shall serve as an ex-officio voting member of the committee.  The Committee will elect a chair of the Committee and the representative on the College Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.

Generally, the Committee’s agenda will be made available to the Faculty one week prior to its meetings. The committee may appoint subcommittees, not necessarily from its own members, as needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary> __Explanation of Changes__ </summary>
- The Faculty Manual requires that faculty representatives serving on University and College committees be elected faculty members. Currently, in order to satisfy this requirement, the School’s Curriculum Committee is defined to be all members of both the Graduate and Undergraduate Affairs Committees. A nominal “election” of the Chair of the Curriculum Committee is then held with the Undergraduate Coordinator being elected Chair. Currently changes to the Undergraduate curricula (or the Graduate curricula) are proposed, discussed and voted on in the Undergraduate Affairs (or the Graduate Affairs) Committee. These changes are then re-proposed discussed and voted on in the Curriculum Committee before advancing out of the School. The proposed change would eliminate the redundancy of curricula changes (after having passed the Undergraduate or Graduate Affairs Committee) having to go through a separate Curriculum Committee.
- In practice the hope is that the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Affairs serve as the chair of the Committee but that is not required.  
</details>

### Section 4: Graduate Affairs and Curriculum Committee 

The Graduate Affairs and Curriculum Committee shall include one representative from each subfaculty. The Assistant Director for Graduate Studies shall serve as an ex-officio voting member of the committee.

A subcommittee of advisors for entering graduate students shall be a standing subcommittee, whose activities shall be coordinated by the Assistant Director for Graduate Studies.
